## Instructions for running code and Dataset locations

Dataset 1: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

Dataset 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess

After downloading datasets look in each file and add data path location to each variable:

data = pd.read_csv('Add IMDB data location here')

game_data = pd.read_csv('Add chess games data location here')



There are two functions(movie_data, chess_game_data) that will need to be commented out and uncommented out when you want to execute model training for each dataset.
