## Instructions for running code and Dataset locations

Dataset 1: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

Dataset 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess

After downloading datasets look in each file and add data path location to each variable:

data = pd.read_csv('Add IMDB data location here')

game_data = pd.read_csv('Add chess games data location here')

There are two functions(movie_data, chess_game_data) that will need to be commented out and uncommented out when you want to execute model training for each dataset.

There is a python file called GridSearch. If you want to run this I've provided comments  inside each function where the params, grid search, etc live. You will need to comment and uncomment out each grid search and params you would like to execute.
